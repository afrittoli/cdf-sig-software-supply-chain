## Overview

This document outlines the roadmap for the Continuous Delivery Foundation (CDF)
Software Supply Chain Special Interest Group (SIG). The roadmap represents the
initiatives of the open source collaborations. The roadmap does not specify
timelines or delivery dates, but rather uses time horizons (now, next, later).

## Charter

The Software Supply Chain SIG aims to study different aspects of CI/CD systems and
share best practices for CI/CD with a focus on securing it to prevent bad actors from
exploiting these systems and the products produced and deployed by them for malicious
intentions.

Please see the SIG charter from [this link](https://github.com/cdfoundation/sig-software-supply-chain/blob/main/README.md).

## Outcomes 

The group will work towards a number of outcomes 

1. **Knowledge Transfer of Software Supply Chain:** We share information
   about open source Software Supply Chain tools, technologies, frameworks
   as well as the initiatives that are undertaken by the CDF and sister
   communities in order to cross-collaborate and pollinate across projects
   and communities.
2. **End User Requirements:** We capture the concerns, considerations, use cases
   the end users have with regards to Software Supply Chain and CI/CD and the
   challenges they are facing and the pain points they are experiencing.
3. **Shared Vocabulary:** We work on contributing to shared vocabulary from Software
   Supply Chain perspective.
4. **Promote Best Practices:** We work on identifying, contributing, and promoting
   best practices that can help organizations the develop, build, and deliver software
   in a secure manner.

### Now 

#### Knowledge Transfer

The CDF SIG Software Supply Chain holds regular presentations to enable knowledge sharing about
open source Software Supply Chain tools, technologies, frameworks as well as the techniques used
by organizations and the initiatives that are undertaken by the CDF and sister communities in order
to cross-collaborate and pollinate across project, communities, and organizations.

#### End User Requirements

End users will share use cases, challenges, and the work they are doing within
their organizations with the community in order to enable dialog and further
collaboration.

In addition to end users presenting to the SIG, [the CDF User Stories Program](https://cd.foundation/blog/2023/02/07/launching-cdf-user-stories-first-up-fidelity-investments/)
features end user organizations to share their requirements, use cases, challenges, and the initiatives
they have are in order to share them with the communities on an ongoing basis.

#### Supply Chain Maturity

Supply Chain Maturity metrics are supplemental to the many details [Dora](https://www.devops-research.com/research.html)
elides and are helpful in identifying gaps in the supply chain that will improve Dora metrics.
Supply Chain Maturity metrics provide milestones like automated rollout, automated rollback, and deployment
tracking that provide the tooling and insights needed to minimize recovery time.

The initial version of the [Supply Chain Maturity metrics](https://github.com/cdfoundation/sig-software-supply-chain/blob/main/docs/supply-chain-maturity.md)
has been developed by the SIG in a collaborative manner and contributions are expected and welcomed in
order to improve it.

### Next

#### Establishing Shared Vocabulary

Various groups within the CDF such as [SIG Interoperability](https://github.com/cdfoundation/sig-interoperability)
and [SIG Events](https://github.com/cdfoundation/sig-events) have been working on
developing a shared vocabulary to help enable the further developments in corresponding
areas. The work is done within the SIG Interoperability repository and the community is
encouraged to contribute to corresponding documents listed below.

* [SIG Interoperability Tools Vocabulary](https://github.com/cdfoundation/sig-interoperability/blob/main/docs/tools-terminology.md)
* [SIG Interoperability Pipelines Vocabulary](https://github.com/cdfoundation/sig-interoperability/blob/main/docs/pipelines-terminology.md)

The vocabulary documents currently lack terminology around Software Supply Chain and the SIG
Software Supply Chain could potentially look into contributing to the shared vocabulary.

#### Supply Chain Security

Supply Chain Security is a critical aspect with regards to Continuous Delivery, from the
software that goes through the pipelines (e.g., source code, artifacts) as well as the
pipelines themselves.

The SIG Software Supply Chain charter explicitly states that the SIG aims to contribute
Software Supply Chain efforts and security is one of the key areas.

### Later

#### Events Standardizations

CDF [CDEvents](https://cdevents.dev) project works on creating a common specification for
Continuous Delivery events in order to achieve interoperability within the CD ecosystem.
The current version of the specification does not have Software Supply Chain related
events and the SIG Software Supply Chain could look for ways to contribute such events
to the project.

Please note that this work depends on the earlier work, Establishing Shared Vocabulary.
