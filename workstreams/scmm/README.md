# Supply Chain Maturity Model Workstream

The Supply Chain Maturity Model workstream was proposed on
[August 25, 2022](https://github.com/cdfoundation/sig-software-supply-chain/blob/main/docs/meetings.md#August-25-2022)
and continued until January 2023.

The workstream produced a [Supply Chain Maturity
Guide](../../docs/supply-chain-maturity.md) which is included this repository.

The below details are maintained for historical purposes.

## Scope

The workstream will cover CICD beyond build and deploy.

## Mission

The workstream seeks to define industry standards for Supply Chain Maturity that
augment [SLSA](http://slsa.dev).  Where SLSA covers the supply chain from code
through artifact, maturity covers the artifact lifecycle, including deployments,
rollouts, testing, rollbacks, and more.

The workstream seeks to define an industry standard to augment [SLSA](http://slsa.dev).

Proposed names so far include:
*  Code Health Project Score ("CHiPS") (but it conflicts with [CHIPS
   Alliance](https://chipsalliance.org/) under the Linux Foundation)
*  Guide for Understanding Application Concerns ("GUAC") (but it conflicts with the [GUAC project](https://github.com/guacsec/guac) from Google/Kusari/Purdue/Citi))

For current goals, see our [roadmap](ROADMAP.md).
